# The Egoless Programmer

- "The benefits of collaborative construction are greatly affected by the egos, or humility, of the participants"
  - “…most of programming is an attempt to compensate for the strictly limited size of our skulls\.  The people who are best at programming are the people who realize how small their brains are\.  They are humble\.  The people who are worst at programming are the people who refuse to accept the fact that their brains aren’t equal to the task\.  Their egos keep them from being great programmers\.  The more you learn to compensate for your small brain\, the better a programmer you’ll be\.  The more humble you are\, the faster you’ll improve\.”
